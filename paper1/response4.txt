| I have reviewed the new version of the paper. I have still a few
| comments that need to be addressed before acceptance.

| 1. p11, l52, col2: the authors state that the parameter $r_{1/2} /
| v_p $ is still recovered in Fig. 11. Looking to the distribution it
| seems to be marginal. The authors should state at "how many standard
| deviations" this is true as visually, the true value seems to be
| overlaping with the very edge of the distribution. In addition,
| Fig. 10-12 (bottom panel) would benefit of having y-labeling.

We have added 90% percent confidence intervals to the figure captions.
On one case, the correct value is not within the 90% interval but is
within the 99% interval, and this is noted in the text.

We have added y-labelling to the lower panels of Figs 10-12.

| 2. p12, l32, col2: "In case of ... of the particular source features
| across the caustic": This is a misleading statement as the source
| size has been assumed here to be very small. This hypothesis on the
| source size needs to be explicit in this part of the discussion! It
| is not only the high quality of the light-curve that is
| important. The small source size (be quantitative !!) is also
| critical, otherwise, the typical features of the crescent disc will
| be washed out.

We have mentioned explicitly that the source is assumed much smaller
than the radius of curvature of the caustic.

| 3. p13, l6, col1: "The respective velocity is an unknown, though it
| can be constrained on a case by case basis to an order of magnitude
| of even better. This would ... with respect to the observer": I
| disagree with this statement. This is overly optimistic as we speak
| of NET transverse velocity which means that the velocity of the
| source w.r.t. the lens also plays a role. Hence, even detailed
| knowledge of the lens dynamics won't allow one to pin down the
| transverse velocity below the stellar velocity dispersion. The
| authors should remove this statement or be more accurate and
| quantitatively motivate it

The statement has been removed.

| YET a number typos left (not exhaustive list):

| - p8, l46, col2: "Do do so, ..." -> To do so, ...

Corrected

| - p11, l8, col2: "It is of course, important **is** that the
| observations ..." -> It is of course important that the observations
| ...

Corrected

| - p12, l55, col1: "Nevertheless, the respective displacement is
| relevant for the calculation **of** of the ... " -> Nevertheless,

Corrected

| - Caption of FIg. 9: "ordonata" -> ordinate [not corrected YET]
