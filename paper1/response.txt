| This paper is an original contribution to the study of AGN structure
| using the microlensing technique. The paper investigates whether the
| shape of the luminosity profile can be extracted from caustic crossing
| events, using a toy model for the source profile. The idea is surely
| worth investigating and the proposed "toy model" for the source
| profile is scientifically relevant and has not been (to my knowledge)
| investigated before in the context of microlensing. Despite of this,
| the paper suffers from a number of flaws that I have listed in my
| report and would like to be corrected prior to considering the paper
| for acceptance. In addition to a rather poor presentation of the
| scientific context and of the results, the paper does not demonstrate
| that "black hole silhouette" could potentially be detected
| observationally as claimed. Although the paper shows that microlensing
| lightcurves of a crescent profile differs significantly from the one
| of a Gaussian profile, it does not show that it does for physically
| realistic astrophysical situations. Indeed, sizes are at best quoted
| in pixels when "realistic situations" are presented. This is
| irrelevant and could easily be adapted by considering the sizes in
| units of Einstein radii and conversions to parsecs assuming some
| stellar mass and source/lens redshifts.
| 
| My comments are listed below:
| 
| 1) The introduction is particularly unsatisfactory. It is rather a
| long abstract/an extended summary rather than an introduction.
| 
| An introduction should :
| 
| - Provide a proper overview of the scientific context.
| 
| - Explain what are the key questions (here: what is the key scientific
|   question / main scientific advance on quasar structure that could be
|   answered with the proposed technique ?)
| 
| - Give an overview of the methodology used to answer this question
|   (here: what is microlensing ? How will it be used to probe quasar
|   structure ?)
| 
| - Put the scientific question in perspective, with proper references
|   to pioneering and related works on the topic. Describe what is new
|   with the present work ?
| 
| - Provide an overview of the structure of the paper (not a detailed
|   summary of each section).
| 
| Unfortunately, I don't think that the current introduction fulfills
| those requirements. In my opinion, the introduction needs to be
| completely re-written with these requirements in mind. This would
| broaden the potential audience of the paper.

Some papers have a long introduction giving the conceptual content of
the later sections without the technical details.  Classic examples
are Shakura & Sunyaev 1973A&A....24..337S on black-hole accretion, and
Braginsky et al 2003PhRvD..67h2001B on the uncertainty principle in
gravitational-wave detectors.  We have tried to follow such a style,
which we find more helpful to readers.
 
| In addition, the introduction suffers from imprecision that make
| several sentences a bit misleading.
|
| For example:
| 
| * p1: l48-49: "If a jet is oriented towards the earth, a quasar is
|   observed". This is correct for a blazar, but quasars by themselves
|   do not always show a clear jet pointed towards the observer. Many
|   quasars are not radio loud and do not show clear sign of a jet at
|   radio wavelengths.
| 
| * The results of the Horizon Event Telescope (Doeleman et al.)
|   motivate the use of a crescent model, but those results are at radio
|   wavelengths where microlensing has currently not been
|   observationally confirmed (Except Koopmans and de Bruyn 2000 who
|   provide supporting evidence for it). The introduction should clarify
|   the domain of usability of the profiles proposed in this work (and
|   in particular crescent profiles, which is also qualitatively similar
|   to relativistic Accretion disc at UV-wavelengths).
| 
| * p1: l47 (col 2): A sentence like "This motivated K & D to use a
|   simple geometric crescent model to fit the data" lacks a bit of
|   specificity. "data" is a too generic word.

Added that it was sub-mm interferometry.

| * magnification maps is a concept that is not clearly introduced to
|   the reader. Also, AGN should be introduced as an acronym l. 42., p1.
| 
| * In addition to Abolmasov and Shakura 2012, a reference to the work
|   of Mediavilla et al. 2015 (ApJ, 814, L26), that studies microlensing
|   of an accretion disc down to the event horizon, is needed. X-ray
|   microlensing studies of AGN and chromatic microlensing studies of
|   the AD may also be worth to quote to give an overview of the
|   insights provided by microlensing on the regions in the direct
|   vicinity of the central supermassive black hole.
| 
| * The motivation for resolving the inner structure of quasar may be
|   expanded.
| 
| * The introduction should also make clear, for the reader unfamiliar
|   with quasar microlensing, that the microlensing events considered
|   here happen in systems that are already multiply imaged and that
|   microlensing affects one of those "macro images". This may avoid
|   confusion is galactic-like microlensing / microlensing by single
|   isolated star.
| 
| 
| 2) I am rather unhappy with Section 5: I do not understand the
| methodology that consists in fitting (exclusively) "wrong models" to
| the data to assess for systematic errors. On the other hand, this
| section, that mimics an observational approach, is totally odd
| regarding the units used as everything is carried out in pixels while
| natural units of microlensing is Einstein radius. The size ratio
| between the Einstein radius and the source size is necessary to figure
| out if the considered source have realistic sizes (i.e. are not
| smaller than e.g. the event horizon of a quasar !). There is other
| unsatisfactory aspects with that section, such as the comparison of
| models using R_p instead of half-light radii (that are, according to
| Mortonson 2005, the most relevant quantity for comparing microlensing
| lightcurves produced for different luminosity profiles and is also
| adequately used in Fig. 4), and the rejection of models based on
| $\Delta \chi^2$ without quoting the latter (i.e. $\Delta \chi^2$). My
| suggestion is to scale the simulations to physical quantities (units
| of Einstein radii are fine provided equivalence to parsecs/Schwarchild
| radii/light-years are provided) and simply compare the same track
| using the various source profiles. It may then be straightforward to
| estimate based on which signal to noise ratio (assuming some sampling
| and number of data points) tracks can be distinguished. This would
| make, I think, a reasonable proof of concepts that such models can
| realistically be probed with good data sets. Ideally, the authors
| could provide their simulated map and image of their source profile
| such that other scientists can match those simulations to various
| observational conditions. These are only suggestions and the authors
| should feel free to implement an alternative scheme when "fitting mock
| data".

This section has been completely rewritten.  We now show a single mock
lightcurve and fits to three different templates: same source form,
same caustic [good fit]; same source form, different caustic
[marginally acceptable fit]; different source form, same caustic
[rejected fit].

| Other comments/remarks regarding Sect. 5: 
| 
| - It is pretty difficult to visualize what are the "\alpha, and \beta"
|   parameters. Either those can be transformed into parameters
|   introduced earlier by rotating the magnification map, either, a
|   figure should clarify their meaning.

We now state values relative to R_p, as done upstream in Section 4.

| - What is the size of the pattern used ? Is the smooth matter fraction
|   different from 0 ?

The half-light radius of the source (30 pixels on the magnification
map, amounting to 24 light-min under reasonable assumption) is now
discussed.

No smooth matter is included.

| - How is carried out the convolution ? Using FFT ?

Since the source is much smaller than the magnification pattern, the
code does not optimise the convolution using and FFT.

| - Is the procedure described in the one but last paragraph of
|   Sect. 5.1. equivalent to convolving the magnification map with an
|   image of the source and extracting a track along direction "A-C-B"
|   (using possibly some interpolation scheme) ?
| 
| - How are the 2\sigma contours in Fig. 12 estimated ? It would not be
|   too difficult to add 1 and 3 sigma contours to the figure.

Only histograms are shown now.  (The earlier version used
quasi-Gaussian estimates. [Irshad, is that correct?])

| - Fitted lightcurves are shorter than the number of observational
|   points. How is this possible ?

The earlier fitting code allowed itself to fit only part of the data.
Fixed in the revised version.

| 3) Various remarks:
| 
| - p3, col2: "due to other reasons" is too vague. The authors could say
|   that $\mu_0$ is a magnification zeorpoint and explain in a separate
|   sentence what this means.
| 
| - Figure 9: What is h_w ?
| 
| - p6, l60, second column: The second paragraph of Sect. 4.3 (There are
|   ...) should start by referring to Figure 8 before explaining the
|   content of the figure.
| 
| - The figure ordering does not always follow the reference in the
|   text. The authors should carefully check that figures appear in
|   logical order and are adequately referenced in the text.
| 
| - Sect. 4.3 introduce a time dependence of the parameter a (i.e. a(t))
|   but this possibility has not been mentioned before. In addition, a
|   is considered to be fixed afterwards. The authors should explain,
|   when introducing a(t) that this quantity is in principle variable if
|   the black hole rotates (I guess) but is assumed to be constant over
|   time in the remaining of the paper.
| 
| - $v_p (t-t_0)$ is a bit misleading notation as v_p could be
|   understood as the velocity being a function of time. The authors
|   should use $v_p \times (t-t_0)$
| 
| - Sect. 6: "in particular, in case ... times": I do not understand
|   from which part of the paper those statements are deduced (links to
|   figures/section should appear explicitly). Overall, the first
|   paragraph of Sect. 6 is not easy to follow.
| 
| - p12, l59-60+: "as magnification maps, we have used a complex ...":
|   This is a misleading as the analysis of Sect. 5 is still for a
|   rather simple of caustics produced by 2 stars of equal mass, and for
|   a lightcurve at a very specific location of the caustic pattern.
| 
| - p12, l45, col2: "This would ... lens": This sentence is wrong
|   because the net transverse velocity associated to a microlensing
|   event has two components: one is indeed associated to the stellar
|   dynamics within the galaxy, but the other one (which can contribute
|   similarly) is the net bulk motion of the lens with respect to the
|   CMB dipole.
| 
| - The discussion (sect 6) may need substantial changes (and be
|   shortened / structured) once Sect 5 is modified according to my
|   suggestions.
| 
| 4) There is a relatively large number of typos left. The authors
| should carefully check for typos prior to submission !
| 
| Non exhaustive list:
| * p2, L60: Figures ??-9
| * p3, L31: mages (instead of images)
| * p4, L46 (col2): is th total -> is the total
| * p5, Eq. 21 and Eq. 22: $dp$ : d should be in roman font
| * Eq. 27: $p_sm$ and $p_sp$ were used and now the equation uses
|   $p_s$. This is misleading.
| * p7: $S_{1D}$ instead of $S_1D$
| * p8: figure 5 (a-var) : remove (a-var)
| * p9, l37: lens lens 
| * p13: Shrdinger -> Schroedinger. 
| 
| 5) General cosmetic remarks:
| 
| - The font used for legends is too small.
| 
| - References to figures should be performed early in the text, prior
|   to discussing them ... not after.
| 
| - Figure 3: The indices of the various quantities are too small. The
|   figure should also show the axis system p \& q.
| 
| - Lightcurves should show "magnitudes" in ordinate (not "ordonata", cf
|   caption of Fig. 9) with "arbitrary zeropoint".
| 
| - The source profile used in Sect. 4.4 should be reproduced in the
|   paper if possible.
