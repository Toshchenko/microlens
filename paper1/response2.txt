| - General picture (aka Introduction): Although I do not find the
|   author's choice of writing their introduction as a long paper
|   summary very enlightening, I respect their choice. Unfortunately,
|   the new version is even less clear than the previous one. In
|   particular, line 33 p2, 1st column (i.e. In Sect. 5 we carry ...) is
|   now (almost) a duplicate of l13, p2, 2nd column (in Sect 5 ...) and
|   comes before description of Sect. 4 (while description of sect. 3
|   has disappeared).
| 
| A few additional minor comments regarding this section are listed hereafter.

The problem with the paragraphs about Sections 3 and 5 has been fixed.
(It appears we goofed while merging edits just before submitting the
manuscript.)

| - Sect. 5.1: a half-light size of 24 light-minutes is given for the
|   quasar. In terms of Schwarshild radius (R_s), this is about a few
|   R_s for a black hole of 10^8 Msun. This quite small for optical
|   emission, but may be plausible for X-ray emission. The authors
|   should expand the discussion regarding the source size considered
|   (which is a key parameter: even if microlensing is achromatic, the
|   projected source size varies with wavelength and is the key
|   governing appearance of microlensing) and explain at which
|   wavelength range such source sizes are expected (a bit as I did
|   here). It would then also be nice to provide estimate of
|   time-lengths of the described microlensing event explicitly.

The time unit (half-light-size/velocity) has now been put into
context, with reference the length of observed events and the inferred
r_{1/2}.  The cited Figure by Mosquera et al. (2013) connects r_{1/2}
and black-hole masses.

| - I am still puzzled by the methodology followed in Sect. 5.2 as it
|   focuses on very specific tracks along the patterns. The domain of
|   validity of the conclusions drawn from this sections remains
|   limited, and in my opinion of little interest. The proposed test
|   demonstrates that for a very specific situation, the difference
|   between a gaussian and a crescent disc is observable under
|   reasonable signal-to-noise assumption (for X-ray data this is not so
|   reasonable, nor the sampling is really achievable). However, for a
|   real situation, the caustic orientation will be unknown as well as
|   the track length (maybe the latter is varied during the MCMC, I
|   missed the information in the text). It would then be necessary to
|   probe any random track direction, derive likelihood for each tracks
|   and hopefully, following a bayesian scheme, derive parameter
|   distributions after marginalizing over all the track orientations
|   (and in principle length/transverse velocity). This approach,
|   followed by e.g. Kochanek 2004, Eigenbrod et al. 2008, Poindexter
|   and Kochanek 2010a,b and others, would allow one to properly probe
|   degeneracies between models and broaden the validity range of the
|   conclusions. A potential alternative (less computationally
|   expensive) procedure would be to fit the mock lightcurve with an
|   ideal fold model and see how well such a modeling performs. Unless
|   one of these two options is followed, I consider sect. 5 as useless
|   (except maybe regarding correspondence between arbitrary units of
|   previous sections and "physical units", but this could be reported
|   in Sect. 4).

The start and end points (which are included as nuisance parameters
and then marginalized out) allow for the unknown track length.  

The track direction is not varied.  For fold caustics, however, the
effect of the track direction is nearly degenerate with a, b, and the
velocity [exactly degenerate for an ideal fold].  It is the track
velocity perpendicular to the fold that matters.  Since this work only
considers folds, omitting the track direction seems reasonable.

We have revised the text to explain the parameter-fitting better, and
also noted that we are using a typical Bayesian MCMC method, similar
to previous microlensing papers.
 
| Minor comments: 
| 
| - General picture: grammar of the text may still need some more
|   polishing.

We have fixed some miscellaneous problems in the text.

| - General picture: "the outflow tend to be collimated to jet": this is
|   an inaccurate statement as there is likely outflowing material that
|   is not collimated. Maybe replace "the outflow" with "outflowing
|   material".

We have made the suggested change.

| - General Picture: "Quasar microlensing is mostly observed in the
|   optical continuum" is a bit misleading as ML is more pronounced in
|   X-ray. Also, the authors should remove "continuum" such that optical
|   refers to the wavelength range (as later X-ray and cm refers also to
|   the wavelength range) -> "Quasar microlensing has been first
|   observed in the optical range" .

We have revised the sentence.

| - General Picture: "mass distribution and kinematics of stars in the
|   lensing galaxy": I do not know any sensible constraint on the
|   kinematics of lensing galaxies from microlensing. The authors should
|   clarify the sentence.

We have removed kinematics.

| - Sect 4.3: Last sentence (in the opposite case ... smoother) is
|   unclear.

We have added "the shape of the lightcurve is smoother".
 
| - Sect. 5: I find the sentence "our method is to generate ... MCMC"
|   too imprecise. A structure (to many respect similar to the first
|   version I received of this paper) like: "First we generate
|   microlensing map. Second the lightcurves for the various source
|   profiles. Third we fit the various mocks lightcurves with
|   lightcurves obtained for different sources" would be more
|   precise. (avoid sentence like "fitting mock lightcurves to source
|   models" which looks like mixing apples and pears; "fitting of
|   lightcurves to recover source parameters" is another possible
|   locution).
| 
| - p9, l8, column 2: "... the brightness distribution of the source is
|   convolved with the magnification map to give the **brightness**" :
|   replace the second brightness in the sentence.

Clarified as "observable total brightness".

| - Sect. 5.1: Noise of 4% of the observed flux was added. Why 4% ? The
|   authors should link this to observational signal to noise ratio for
|   photometry.
 
| - Figure 10 and 11 would benefit from having, as vertical lines, the
|   "true"/input source parameters. The caption should also indicate,
|   together with the chi^2, the number of degrees of freedom.

Figures and captions modified as suggested.
