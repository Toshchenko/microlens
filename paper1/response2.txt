| - General picture (aka Introduction): Although I do not find the
|   author's choice of writing their introduction as a long paper
|   summary very enlightening, I respect their choice. Unfortunately,
|   the new version is even less clear than the previous one. In
|   particular, line 33 p2, 1st column (i.e. In Sect. 5 we carry ...) is
|   now (almost) a duplicate of l13, p2, 2nd column (in Sect 5 ...) and
|   comes before description of Sect. 4 (while description of sect. 3
|   has disappeared).
  = [I think this should be merged with the first paragraph 
    on the second column of the same page - if you agree Prasenjit]

  

| 
| A few additional minor comments regarding this section are listed hereafter.
| 
| - Sect. 5.1: a half-light size of 24 light-minutes is given for the
|   quasar. In terms of Schwarshild radius (R_s), this is about a few
|   R_s for a black hole of 10^8 Msun. This quite small for optical
|   emission, but may be plausible for X-ray emission. The authors
|   should expand the discussion regarding the source size considered
|   (which is a key parameter: even if microlensing is achromatic, the
|   projected source size varies with wavelength and is the key
|   governing appearance of microlensing) and explain at which
|   wavelength range such source sizes are expected (a bit as I did
|   here). It would then also be nice to provide estimate of
|   time-lengths of the described microlensing event explicitly.
| 
| - I am still puzzled by the methodology followed in Sect. 5.2 as it
|   focuses on very specific tracks along the patterns. The domain of
|   validity of the conclusions drawn from this sections remains
|   limited, and in my opinion of little interest. The proposed test
|   demonstrates that for a very specific situation, the difference
|   between a gaussian and a crescent disc is observable under
|   reasonable signal-to-noise assumption (for X-ray data this is not so
|   reasonable, nor the sampling is really achievable). However, for a
|   real situation, the caustic orientation will be unknown as well as
|   the track length (maybe the latter is varied during the MCMC, I
|   missed the information in the text). It would then be necessary to
|   probe any random track direction, derive likelihood for each tracks
|   and hopefully, following a bayesian scheme, derive parameter
|   distributions after marginalizing over all the track orientations
|   (and in principle length/transverse velocity). This approach,
|   followed by e.g. Kochanek 2004, Eigenbrod et al. 2008, Poindexter
|   and Kochanek 2010a,b and others, would allow one to properly probe
|   degeneracies between models and broaden the validity range of the
|   conclusions. A potential alternative (less computationally
|   expensive) procedure would be to fit the mock lightcurve with an
|   ideal fold model and see how well such a modeling performs. Unless
|   one of these two options is followed, I consider sect. 5 as useless
|   (except maybe regarding correspondence between arbitrary units of
|   previous sections and "physical units", but this could be reported
|   in Sect. 4).
| 
| Minor comments: 
| 
| - General picture: grammar of the text may still need some more
|   polishing.
  = [We can do this at the end]

| 
| - General picture: "the outflow tend to be collimated to jet": this is
|   an inaccurate statement as there is likely outflowing material that
|   is not collimated. Maybe replace "the outflow" with "outflowing
|   material".
   = We have made the suggested changes

| 
| - General Picture: "Quasar microlensing is mostly observed in the
|   optical continuum" is a bit misleading as ML is more pronounced in
|   X-ray. Also, the authors should remove "continuum" such that optical
|   refers to the wavelength range (as later X-ray and cm refers also to
|   the wavelength range) -> "Quasar microlensing has been first
|   observed in the optical range" .
   = We have replaced the sentence with the one suggested by the reviewer.
| 
| - General Picture: "mass distribution and kinematics of stars in the
|   lensing galaxy": I do not know any sensible constraint on the
|   kinematics of lensing galaxies from microlensing. The authors should
|   clarify the sentence.
   = We have removed kinematics 

| - Sect 4.3: Last sentence (in the opposite case ... smoother) is
|   unclear.
   = We have added "the shape of the lightcurve is smoother"
| 
| - Sect. 5: I find the sentence "our method is to generate ... MCMC"
|   too imprecise. A structure (to many respect similar to the first
|   version I received of this paper) like: "First we generate
|   microlensing map. Second the lightcurves for the various source
|   profiles. Third we fit the various mocks lightcurves with
|   lightcurves obtained for different sources" would be more
|   precise. (avoid sentence like "fitting mock lightcurves to source
|   models" which looks like mixing apples and pears; "fitting of
|   lightcurves to recover source parameters" is another possible
|   locution).
| 
| - p9, l8, column 2: "... the brightness distribution of the source is
|   convolved with the magnification map to give the **brightness**" :
|   replace the second brightness in the sentence.
   = [ To Prasenjit: I suggest to use light flux instead - this is in section 5]
| 
| - Sect. 5.1: Noise of 4% of the observed flux was added. Why 4% ? The
|   authors should link this to observational signal to noise ratio for
|   photometry.
 
| - Figure 10 and 11 would benefit from having, as vertical lines, the
|   "true"/input source parameters. The caption should also indicate,
|   together with the chi^2, the number of degrees of freedom.

Figures and captions modified accordingly.
